<h1 align="center"> Pokedex App </h1>

Description: I am using the pokeApi to create a pokemon list, with an infinity scrool, in the main screen we have te pokemon list, when we enter the pokemon details scren we have the image of that pokemon, a tab with informations about that pokemon, a tab with his status(hp, attack, defense, ...) and another tab with the evolutions of that pokemon.

Tolls:
- PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/)
- Kotlin
